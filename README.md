## Breakout! Game

Use the HTML5 Canvas Element and Vanilla JavaScript to allow the player to control a paddle with the arrow keys. Paddle will bounce a ball up to break bricks, score will be kept based on number of bricks broken.<br/> This project is based on [@bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s Udemy tutorial from his [20 Web Projects with Vanilla JS](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) course, which I highly recommend!
